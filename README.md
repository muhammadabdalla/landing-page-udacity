# Landing Page Project

#notes:

-In this project I have built a landing page in which I can add navbar headers automatically depending on
 the sections which I have in the page .
-I also added styles to the sections in which I stand on while scrolling .
-You can also go to the section which you want by clicking on it's name in navbar.
